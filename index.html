  <h4 class="subsection">About SBFT</h4>
  <p>Optimization techniques can be
    applied to many aspects of the software development process:
    research areas known as Search-Based Software Engineering
    (SBSE).
    In our previous workshop editions, we focused on the application of SBSE to perform testing tasks, the so called
    Search-Based Software Testing (SBST).
    Ongoing research on SBST and Fuzz Testing are proposing techniques to address similar testing problems and with
    similar goals.
    This has led to the decision to rename the workshop to <b>Search-Based and Fuzz Testing (SBFT)</b>.
    SBFT strategies have been applied to a wide variety of testing goals
    including achieving high coverage, finding faults and vulnerabilities, and
    checking various state-based and non-functional properties (e.g., scalability, acceptance).
  </p>
  <p>
    The central objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers
    and industrial practitioners from SBST, Fuzzing, and the wider Software
    Engineering community to share experience and provide directions for
    future research on the automation of software testing.
    The second objective of this workshop is to encourage the use of search and fuzzing techniques to
    combine testing with other software engineering areas.
    SBFT is a one-day workshop that comprises a research track, keynotes, and popular
    testing tool competitions. Additionally, the workshop brings together experts for a panel discussion.
    All those activities will contribute to break new ground in SBFT research.</p>


  <h4 class="subsection">Attending SBFT</h4>
  <p>
    SBFT 2023 is co-located with <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2023" target="_blank">ICSE 2023</a>.
    However, SBFT will be held in a hybrid setting.
    <br>
    In order to attend SBFT, you have to register for our workshop using the official <a
      href="https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icse-2023/registration" target="_blank">ICSE
      registration link</a>.
    <br>
    Once you registered for SBFT, the ICSE team will send you an e-mail with the invitation to attend
    the conference online or in person, according to your preference.
  </p>
  <p class="paper-title">
    <b>Similar to last year, we will also live-stream SBFT 2023 via <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/koxp"
        target="_blank">Twitch</a></b>. Feel free to join our stream
    and ask questions in the chat if you are not registered.
  </p>

  <h4 class="subsection">Special Issue</h4>
  <p>
    We are please to announce that SBFT'23 is hosting an <b>open call</b> special issue at the <a
      href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming/about/call-for-papers#sbft-23-search-based-and-fuzz-testing-tools"
      target="_blank">Science
      of Computer Programming Journal</a>, called <b>SBFT'23: Search-Based and Fuzz Testing Tools</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit tools showcasing new or improved SBFT
    approaches. It is important to mention that this call for original software does not publish papers
    accompanied by software but expects short papers supported by artifacts such as the original
    software described in the papers together with all the experimental packages, and other data needed
    for for sake of reproducibility. Hence, we invite submissions showing practical experience of using
    SBST techniques and tools.
  </p>
  <p>This is the perfect opportunity to showcase your tool. Use the following link for more information
    and submission instructions:
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming/about/call-for-papers#sbft-23-search-based-and-fuzz-testing-tools"
      target="_blank">Science of Computer Programming Call</a>
  </p>


  <h4 class="subsection">Call for Papers</h4>
  <p>Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Full papers (maximum of 8 pages, including references) Original research in SBFT, either
      empirical, theoretical, or showing practical experience of using SBFT techniques and/or SBFT
      tools.</li>
    <li>Short papers (maximum of 4 pages, including references) Work that describes novel techniques,
      ideas and positions that have yet to be fully developed; or are a discussion of the importance of
      a recently published SBFT result by another author in setting a direction for the SBFT community,
      and/or the potential applicability (or not) of the result in an industrial context.</li>
    <li>Position papers (maximum of 2 pages, including references) that analyze trends in SBFT and raise
      issues of importance. Position papers are intended to seed discussion and debate at the workshop,
      and thus will be reviewed with respect to relevance and their ability to spark discussions.</li>
    <li>Tool Competition entries (maximum of 4 pages, including references). We invite researchers,
      students, and tool developers to design innovative new approaches to software test generation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In all cases, papers should address a problem in the software testing/verification/validation
    domain or combine elements of those domains with other concerns in the software engineering
    lifecycle. Examples of problems in the software testing/verification/validation domain include (but
    are not limited to) generating testing data, fuzzing, prioritizing test cases, constructing test
    oracles, minimizing test suites, verifying software models, testing service-orientated
    architectures, constructing test suites for interaction testing, SBFT for AI applications, machine
    learning techniques for SBFT, and validating realtime properties.</p>
  <p>The solution should apply any kind of fuzzing or a metaheuristic search strategy such as (but not limited to)
    random
    search, local search (e.g. hill climbing, simulated annealing, and tabu search), evolutionary
    algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and genetic programming), ant colony
    optimization, particle swarm optimization, and multi-objective optimization.</p>
